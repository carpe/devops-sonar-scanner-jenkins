# DEVOPS' Sonarcloud Plugin README

## Background
Our Jenkins UI is getting locked on multi-branch pipelines after some indeterminent abount of time.  The assumption is weâ€™re getting throttled by a non-authenticated call to the API https://sonarcloud/api/server/version.  We want to try modifying the plugin to hard-code this return value from this call, thus eliminating this throttling.

Apply the patch from this issue:
https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-70694?focusedId=441129&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-441129
